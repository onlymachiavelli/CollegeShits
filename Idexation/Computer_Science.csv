From autonomous vehicles and medical imaging to satellite imagery analysis, CNNs are powering a wide range of applications that rely on visual perception and understanding."

D99,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of deep learning models designed to process sequential data with temporal dependencies, such as text, speech, and time-series data. Unlike feedforward neural networks, which process input data in a single pass, RNNs maintain internal state or memory, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies and context information. With architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), RNNs have demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition."

D100,"Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on creating algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It includes techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, driving innovation in various fields like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles."
